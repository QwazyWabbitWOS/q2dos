To port a mod to Q2DOS the following changes must occur:

* q_shared.c and q_shared.h need to be merged with the ones in /game.
  There as some string safe functions that are used throughout the engine
  as well as some DJGPP specific stuff.  It's needed!

* game.h needs dprintf changed to:
  void (*dprintf) (unsigned long developerFlags, char *fmt, ...);

* ALL gi.dprintfs need to be changed to this format:
  gi.dprintf (DEVELOPER_MSG_GAME, "%s", ...)
  
  This is so you can use the developer flags to filter game dll
  specific messages.
  
* DX3 has to be built with -U.  Start the game and see if you see any
  complaints upon cinematic/demo/map load about missing functions that
  should be reported as a bug.  It is also reported to stdout so you can
  run q2.exe +set game <yourmod> >out.txt to capture it.
  
  Added the exports to the family of DXE_EXPORTS in sys_dos.c
  Please report these to me.  The common ones mods use have been added.
  
Good luck!
