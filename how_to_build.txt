Windows: * makeallDXE.bat to build the entire source, including mods.
         * makesse.bat will build an SSE optimized build targeted for Pentium 3
           and later processors with 3DFX cards.  SSE builds are entirely
           unsupported but appear to run with no issues.
         * minimal.bat to build an cut-down Q2DOS with no TCP/IP, Gamespy, cURL,
           OGG/Vorbis, and PCI Sound card support.
           Mostly for testing purposes.
         * NOTE: makesse.bat and release.bat have hard-coded paths to my
                 machine for distribution.  Check these batch files and modify
                 to your needs.

Linux: * TODO sezero.
