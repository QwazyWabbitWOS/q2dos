Welcome to the Quake II for MS-DOS port.
By Neozeed and [HCI]Mara'akate.


What's required?
* Pentium 1.  At least a 133MHz to play it at 20fps.
* 32MB RAM.  16MB RAM might be OK.
* LFN TSR.  Use the included DOSLFN.ZIP (can be loaded high with LH DLFN.COM)

What works?

* VGA
* SVGA
* Mouse
* Keyboard
* SoundBlaster and Gravis UltraSound Family
* CD-ROM music
* OGG music
* Networking (You need a packet driver)

What doesn't work

* Modern sound cards like AC'97 or HDA
* Loading/unloading of DLLs.  No other game modes, but connecting to custom
  servers is OK.
* Playing in a Win9x or NTVDM DOS box.

Run /slist2 to get a gamespy list of active servers.  Use Ctrl+c to abort.
