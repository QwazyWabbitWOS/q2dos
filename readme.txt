Welcome to the Quake II for MS-DOS port.

What works?

* VGA
* SVGA
* Mouse
* Keyboard
* SoundBlaster and Gravis UltraSound Family
* CD-ROM music
* OGG music
* Networking (You need a packet driver)

What doesn't work

* Changing video modes on the fly during a game (use disconnect first).
* Modern sound cards like AC'97 or HDA
* Loading/unloading of DLLs.  No other game modes, but connecting to custom
  servers is OK.
